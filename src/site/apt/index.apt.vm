Reproducible Build Maven Plugin

*Please Note - This is a work in progress. This plugin requires Java 8 runtime.
  
 Have you ever tried to compile twice the same sources with Maven and compared the hashes of the generated artifacts? They are not the same! Maven is not able to build an artifact in a real reproducible (i.e. byte-for-byte) way.
 
 This Maven plugin tries to strip "non reproducible" data from the generated artifacts. It follows the same goals as {{{https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds}Debian's Reproducible Builds project}} but at the modest scale of a Maven project.
 
 Using this plugin is a no-brainer: simply add it to your pom and it will try to "automagically" make the build byte-for-byte reproducible.
 
 Currently, the "strip" goal processes all the ZIP/JAR/WAR/EAR files found in the target repository and does the following things:
 
  * sorts ZIP entries by name,
  
  * removes file timestamps in ZIP entries,
  
  * removes timestamps, user names and tool versions in MANIFEST.MF,
  
  * removes comments in pom.properties file (some of them can contain time/date).
 
 There is also a "fix-xjc" goal that normalizes ObjectFactory.java files generated by the JAXB xjc tool
 (before JAXB 2.2.11, xjc generates ObjectFactory.java files where the methods
 are put in a non-predictable order, which produces non-reproductible class files. Cf. issue {{{https://java.net/jira/browse/JAXB-598}JAXB-598}}).
 
 If you find other interesting sources of "non reproducible" data that this plugin could remove, please open a ticket in the bug tracker or send a pull request.
